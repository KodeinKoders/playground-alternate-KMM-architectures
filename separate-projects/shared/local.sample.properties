# Please set at least one of these two properties.

# Location of the Android SDK installation directory
#sdk.dir=/path/to/sdk

# Skip Android all together (both the app and in the shared library)
# Note that this property has precedence over sdk.dir:
# If both are set, Android will still be excluded.
#skip.android=true
